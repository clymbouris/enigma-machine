# Enigma Macine
The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-twentieth century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II. Several different Enigma models were produced, but the German military models are the most commonly recognised.

## Usage
Clone repo and run `enigma.js` in a console (either on DevTools window or a js shell).
```
git clone git@github.com:d3moid/enigma-machine.git
```

##Purpose
An attempt to mimic Enigma Machine's components in an object-oriented way using arrays. The end goal is to someday make a web-based GUI out of it.
